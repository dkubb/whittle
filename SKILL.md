# whittle

Whittle is a Rust library for parse-don't-validate domain types. You hand it
a raw `T` and a `Rule<T>` marker that names the invariant; if the rule's
`refine` accepts, you get back a `Refined<T, R>` whose existence is the
proof that the invariant held at construction. Downstream code receives the
nominal newtype wrapping that `Refined`, not the bare primitive, so the type
system witnesses what was checked and where. The big idea is a hard split
between the domain surface and the implementation: the newtype is the
domain, the rule composition that produced it is implementation, and the
error surface is a flat domain enum that never leaks `And`/`Or` machinery.
Construction is the single boundary; downstream code trusts the type.

## When to Activate

- The user wants to introduce a domain newtype (identifier, percentage,
  bounded length, hex hash, relative path, non-empty list, ...) and is
  reaching for `String`, `i32`, `Vec<T>` directly.
- The user is hand-rolling `try_new` / `from_str` validators that return
  ad-hoc errors and is about to scatter the same predicate across modules.
- The user wants `serde` to refuse invalid payloads instead of accepting
  them and panicking later, or wants `proptest::Arbitrary` strategies that
  emit valid domain values without `prop_assume!` filtering downstream.
- The user is replacing primitive-typed fields on a struct ("`age: u8`",
  "`name: String`", "`path: String`") with stronger types.
- The user already uses whittle in this repo and is adding another bounded
  type, fixing an error-leak, or stacking transformers / rules.

## When Not to Use

- The invariant is dynamic — depends on runtime configuration, another
  field, a database lookup, or a value the type system cannot witness at
  the boundary. Use a constructor-side check; whittle's `Rule` is a pure
  function on a single value.
- The carrier should mutate in place after construction. Whittle exposes
  only `into_inner` → mutate → `try_new`; there is no `as_mut`.
- The invariant is a multi-field consistency check on a struct. Whittle
  refines one value at a time; cross-field invariants belong in a smart
  constructor on the struct itself.
- You want a `&str` carrier. Whittle's `Rule<T>` requires `T: 'static`;
  every string primitive is `Rule<String>`.
- You want to embed user-friendly localised error text. Whittle errors are
  machine-readable variants with a stable `Display`; localisation is the
  caller's concern.

## Mental Model

`Rule<T>` is a one-method trait: `fn refine(raw: T) -> Result<T, Self::Error>`.
A rule is a narrowing morphism — it takes ownership of the input, may
canonicalise it (lowercase, trim, NFC-normalise), and returns the value on
success or a typed error on rejection. Rules are zero-sized marker types
(`enum NonNeg {}` / `struct Positive`); they carry no instance state and
compose at the type level. See `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:29`.

`Refined<T, R>` is the carrier: a `#[repr(transparent)]` wrapper around `T`
with a `PhantomData<fn() -> R>` tag. Its existence is the proof that
`R::refine` returned `Ok` at construction. The sole public construction
path is `Refined::try_new`, which calls `R::refine`. `serde::Deserialize`
routes through `try_new`. `proptest::Arbitrary` routes through `try_new`.
There is no escape hatch. See `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:122`,
`crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:287`, and `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:314`.

Composition is at the type level via `And<A, B>` and `Or<A, B>` (see
`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`). Both rules must share the
same `Rule::Error` type: `And<A, B>` short-circuits on left failure
and returns the shared `E` directly; `Or<A, B>` retries the right
side with a clone of the original input and returns `[E; 2]` when
both reject. There is no positional `Left`/`Right` wrapping in the
composition's `Self::Error` — the rules' flat error enum surfaces to
callers as-is. N-ary `All<(...)>` / `Any<(...)>` operators are
planned follow-up.

Transformers (`AsciiLowercase<R>`, `AsciiUppercase<R>`, `Trim<R>`, see
`crates/whittle-core/src/transform.rs`) normalise before delegating to
the inner rule. The stored carrier is the canonical form, not the input
verbatim — `try_new("ABCD")` and `try_new("abcd")` through
`AsciiLowercase<HexFixedAny<4>>` produce equal `Refined` values.

The load-bearing pattern is: the user-facing type is a hand-written or
macro-generated newtype around `Refined<T, R>`, with a hand-written
flat error enum. The `And`/`Or` composition is the rule machinery
underneath; because both inner rules share an error type, the
composition surfaces a flat enum (or `[E; 2]` for `Or`) that the
newtype's `try_new` maps into named domain variants. The newtype is
the domain; `Refined<T, R>` is implementation.

## Core API

- `Rule<T>` (trait, `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:29`): one method
  `fn refine(raw: T) -> Result<T, Self::Error>`. `Self::Error` is the
  rule's typed rejection. Implementers discharge the soundness obligation:
  `Ok(y)` implies `y` is admissible under the rule. Markers are zero-sized.
- `Refined<T, R>` (carrier, `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs:83`):
  `#[repr(transparent)]` over `T`. Methods:
  `try_new(raw) -> Result<Self, R::Error>`, `as_inner(&self) -> &T`,
  `into_inner(self) -> T`. Forwards
  `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `Hash`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`
  to `T` with no rule wrapper noise.
- `Implies<W>` + `Refined::weaken` (`crates/whittle-core/src/implies.rs`):
  explicit "rule S is logically stronger than rule W" edges (IDEA §5.7).
  `weaken::<W>()` upcasts `Refined<T, S>` to `Refined<T, W>` by moving the
  inner value — no narrowing morphism re-runs. Library edges cover numeric
  range narrowing (`Within`/`AtLeast`/`AtMost`/`GreaterThan`/`LessThan`)
  and length narrowing (`LenChars`/`LenBytes`/`LenItems`); an invalid
  widening (target does not contain the source range) is a compile error
  at the `weaken` call site via the `const VALID` monomorphisation gate.
- `refinement!` (macro, `crates/whittle-core/src/macros.rs:345`): two
  forms. The simple form expands `pub Foo: Inner, Rule;` to
  `pub struct Foo(Refined<Inner, Rule>)` plus `try_new`, `as_inner`,
  `into_inner`, with `<Rule as Rule<Inner>>::Error` returned unchanged.
  The **error-block form** — the recommended shape for composed rules —
  appends `error SourceErr => pub FooError { ... }` and additionally
  generates the flat domain error enum (hand-rolled `Display` +
  `core::error::Error`, per-arm display literals, doc passthrough per
  variant and field), an `ErrorMapper` impl on the enum itself (the
  newtype wraps `Refined<Inner, MapErr<Rule, FooError>>`, so the
  mapping has one determinant shared by `try_new` and serde ingress),
  `AsRef<Inner>`, opt-in carrier `Display` via `impl Display;`, and —
  behind the `serde` feature — transparent `Serialize`/`Deserialize`
  whose rejection text at ingress is the domain `Display` string. The
  `unreachable` arm lists residual source variants explicitly (no `_`
  catch-all): a new source variant breaks the declaration at compile
  time. Inherited attrs (`#[derive(...)]`, doc comments) pass through
  to the generated items in both forms.
- `ClosedSet` + `closed_set!` (`crates/whittle-core/src/closed_set.rs`,
  macro in `crates/whittle-core/src/macros.rs`): closed-set enums —
  wire string ↔ variant, declared once. Not a `Rule`/`Refined` pair:
  the enum itself is the constructive target. The macro generates the
  enum, the injective `MEMBERS` table (duplicate wire strings rejected
  at compile time via the `const VALID` gate; duplicate variants are a
  duplicate-definition error), the standard derive set, and
  `FromStr`/`TryFrom<&str>`/`Display` plus serde impls forwarding to
  `closed_set::parse` / `closed_set::as_str`. See the closed-set
  pattern below for when to choose it over `Pattern` or a plain enum.
- `And<A, B>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`): both rules
  must accept; `A::refine` runs first, output threaded into `B::refine`.
  Both rules must share `Rule::Error = E`. `Self::Error = E` — the
  shared flat enum surfaces directly with no positional wrapping.
- `Or<A, B>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`): either rule
  may accept; on left failure the right rule runs against a clone of the
  original input. Requires `T: Clone`. Both rules must share
  `Rule::Error = E`. `Self::Error = [E; 2]` when both reject — the
  left rejection first, the right rejection second.
- `Not<R>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`): inverts the
  inner rule — admits exactly what `R` rejects. The current impl is
  restricted to numeric carriers: `T: Numeric + Copy` and
  `R: Rule<T, Error = NumericError>`. Emits
  `NumericError::OutOfRange` when `R` accepts.
  `type NotEqualTo<const N: i128> = Not<EqualTo<N>>` is the
  canonical use; `NonZero` chains through `NotEqualTo<0>`.
- `Xor<A, B>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`): exactly
  one of `A` and `B` must accept. Same numeric-only constraint as
  `Not<R>`. Emits `NumericError::OutOfRange` when both accept or
  both reject.
- `All<(R1, R2, ..., RN)>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`):
  n-ary `And`. Every operand must accept; sequential like `And`,
  threading output. `Self::Error = E` (shared). Supported arities
  2..=8.
- `Any<(R1, R2, ..., RN)>` (`crates/whittle-core/src/composition.rs`):
  n-ary `Or`. Any operand may accept; tries in order against a
  clone, returns the first acceptance or `[E; N]` on full
  rejection. Requires `T: Clone`. Supported arities 2..=8.
- Transformers (`crates/whittle-core/src/transform.rs`): `AsciiLowercase<R>`,
  `AsciiUppercase<R>`, `Trim<R>`. Each is a `Rule<String>` that normalises
  the input then delegates to `R`; `Self::Error = R::Error`.

## Primitive Catalog

Numeric (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/numeric.rs`, `Rule<T: Numeric>`,
all return `NumericError`):

- `Within<MIN, MAX>` — inclusive `MIN..=MAX` (`i128` const generics);
  nominal domain newtype hiding `And<AtLeast, AtMost>`.
- `AtLeast<MIN>` — `MIN <= value` (closed lower bound).
- `AtMost<MAX>` — `value <= MAX` (closed upper bound).
- `GreaterThan<MIN>` — `MIN < value` (open lower bound; strict
  counterpart of `AtLeast`).
- `LessThan<MAX>` — `value < MAX` (open upper bound; strict
  counterpart of `AtMost`). Compose `GreaterThan` and `LessThan`
  via `And` for the half-open and open-open ranges (PostgreSQL
  range syntax `(MIN, MAX]`, `[MIN, MAX)`, `(MIN, MAX)`).
- `EqualTo<N>` — admits only `value == N` (singleton). Panics at
  proptest strategy construction if `N` doesn't fit the carrier.
- `NotEqualTo<N>` — admits every value except `N` (dual of
  `EqualTo`).
- `NonZero` — type alias for `NotEqualTo<0>`.
- `Positive` — type alias for `GreaterThan<0>` (`value > 0`).
- `Negative` — type alias for `LessThan<0>` (`value < 0`).
- `Numeric` trait — `into_i128` / `from_i128`; implemented for
  `i8..=i128`, `u8..=u64`, `usize`, `isize`. `u128` is intentionally not
  supported (cannot round-trip through `i128`).

String (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/string.rs`, `Rule<String>`, all
return `StringError`):

- `LenChars<MIN, MAX>` — inclusive Unicode-scalar-count bound.
- `LenBytes<MIN, MAX>` — inclusive UTF-8 byte-length bound.
- `NonEmpty` — rejects the empty string.
- `EachChar<P>` — every char must satisfy `P: CharPredicate`.
- `FirstChar<P>` — first char (if any) must satisfy `P`. Empty string is
  admitted; compose with a length bound to forbid empty.
- `CharPredicate` trait — `fn test(ch: char) -> bool`.
- Built-in predicates: `AsciiAlphanumeric`, `IdentChar` (alnum or `_`),
  `IdentStart` (alpha or `_`), `IdentDashChar` (alnum, `_`, `-`),
  `NonControl`, `HexChar` (behind `hex`), `PrintableLine`,
  `PrintableMultiline`, and `PrintableChar` (behind `unicode`).
  `PrintableChar` is the strictest: it rejects the Unicode General
  Categories Cc/Cf/Cs/Co/Cn/Zl/Zp via `unicode-general-category`.
- `HexFixedLower<LEN>` (feature `hex`) — exactly `LEN` lowercase hex
  chars; `LEN` must be even (compile-time `const { assert!(...) }`).
- `HexFixedAny<LEN>` (feature `hex`) — exactly `LEN` mixed-case hex chars.
- `HexFixedNormalized<LEN>` (feature `hex`) — type alias for
  `AsciiLowercase<HexFixedAny<LEN>>`; admits any case, stores lowercase.

Float (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/float.rs`, `Rule<F: Float>`,
return `FloatError`; `Float` implemented for `f32`, `f64`, sealed):

- `NotNan` — rejects NaN; admits infinities.
- `NotInfinite` — rejects `+/-INF`; admits NaN.
- `Finite` — rejects NaN and infinities (nominal newtype hiding
  `And<NotNan, NotInfinite>`, flat `FloatError`).
- `InClosedRange` with four `i64` const generics
  (`MIN_NUMERATOR`, `MIN_DENOMINATOR`, `MAX_NUMERATOR`,
  `MAX_DENOMINATOR`) — closed range written as numerator /
  denominator ratios because Rust 2024 lacks `f64` const generics.
  `InClosedRange<0, 1, 1, 1>` is `0.0..=1.0`,
  `InClosedRange<1, 2, 3, 4>` is `0.5..=0.75`.

Collection (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/collection.rs`,
`Rule<Vec<T>>`, return `CollectionError` or `CollectionError<EI>`):

- `LenItems<MIN, MAX>` — inclusive item-count bound.
- `AllItems<R>` — every item refined through `R`; error variant is
  `BadItem { index, source: R::Error }`.
- `UniqueByKey<T, K>` — items unique under `K: KeyOf<T>`; reports the
  second occurrence's index.
- `Distinct<T>` — type alias for `UniqueByKey<T, IdentityKey<T>>`.
- `Sorted<T, K>` — non-strict ascending by key (equal adjacent keys
  admissible). Reports the index of the first out-of-order element.
- `NoneOf<P>` — forbid items matching `P: Predicate<T>`.
- `AnyOf<P>` — require at least one item matching `P`.
- `KeyOf<T>` trait — extracts an owned `Ord + Clone` key from `&T`.
- `IdentityKey<T>` — `T` is its own key (requires `T: Ord + Clone`).
- `Predicate<T>` trait — `fn test(&T) -> bool`; distinct from `Rule`
  because predicates only answer yes/no, they neither validate nor
  produce an output.

Path (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/path.rs`, `Rule<String>`, returns
`PathError`):

- `RelativePath` — non-empty, no leading `/`, no Windows drive letter or
  UNC prefix, no empty segments (no `//`, no trailing `/`), no `..`
  segments. Error variants: `PathError::Empty`, `PathError::Absolute`,
  `PathError::ParentTraversal { index }`,
  `PathError::EmptySegment { index }`.

Pattern (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/pattern.rs`, `Rule<String>`,
returns `PatternError`; behind the `regex` Cargo feature):

- `Pattern<const RE: &'static str>` — admits a `String` only when the
  regex `RE` matches the **whole** input (the rule enforces a full-span
  match, so anchors are optional). The pattern rides in the type as a
  `&'static str` const generic. Single error variant:
  `PatternError::NoMatch` (opaque — it carries neither the pattern nor
  the input). Prefer the `pattern!(r"...")` macro over a hand-written
  `Pattern<"...">`: the macro validates the regex at compile time,
  whereas a bare `Pattern<RE>` with a malformed `RE` panics on first
  construction.

  When to reach for it: `Pattern` is the **escape hatch for positional
  grammars** — shapes like "uppercase initial, then dash-separated
  alphabetic runs" (`r"^(?:[A-Z])(?:-?[A-Za-z]+)*$"`) that the
  composable character-class rules (`EachChar`, `FirstChar`,
  `CharEither`, `CharExcept`, ...) cannot express ergonomically.
  Reach for the character-class rules first: they compose, give
  character-precise errors, and keep the crate `#![no_std]` with zero
  dependencies. The costs of `Pattern` are real: it requires the
  `regex` feature, which pulls in `std`, the `regex` crate, and the
  nightly `adt_const_params` / `unsized_const_params` const-generic
  features; its `NoMatch` error is opaque; and the regex is compiled
  (and cached) at runtime on first use rather than at compile time.

Date (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/date.rs`,
`Rule<chrono::NaiveDate>`, return `DateError`; behind the `chrono`
Cargo feature):

- `DateAtLeast<MIN_DAYS_FROM_CE>` — admit dates with
  `value.num_days_from_ce() >= MIN_DAYS_FROM_CE`.
- `DateAtMost<MAX_DAYS_FROM_CE>` — admit dates with
  `value.num_days_from_ce() <= MAX_DAYS_FROM_CE`.
- `DateInRange<MIN_DAYS_FROM_CE, MAX_DAYS_FROM_CE>` — nominal newtype
  hiding `And<DateAtLeast<MIN>, DateAtMost<MAX>>`, flat `DateError`.
  Bounds encoded as `i32` days from CE (`NaiveDate::num_days_from_ce`
  — e.g. `730_120` for 2000-01-01, `767_009` for 2100-12-31) because
  Rust 2024 lacks `NaiveDate` const generics. Compile-time
  `const { ... }` checks confirm both bounds are within
  `NaiveDate`'s representable range and that `MIN <= MAX`.

DateTime (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/datetime.rs`,
`Rule<chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>>`, return `DateTimeError`;
behind the `chrono` Cargo feature):

- `DateTimeAtLeast<MIN_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH>` — admit datetimes with
  `value.timestamp() >= MIN_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH`.
- `DateTimeAtMost<MAX_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH>` — admit datetimes with
  `value.timestamp() <= MAX_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH`.
- `DateTimeInRange<MIN_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH, MAX_SECS_SINCE_EPOCH>` —
  nominal newtype hiding
  `And<DateTimeAtLeast<MIN>, DateTimeAtMost<MAX>>`, flat
  `DateTimeError`. Bounds encoded as `i64` seconds since the Unix
  epoch (`DateTime::<Utc>::timestamp` — e.g. `1_704_067_200` for
  2024-01-01 UTC) because Rust 2024 lacks `DateTime` const generics.
  Same compile-time checks as `DateInRange`. Only the `Utc` time
  zone is supported; convert at the boundary for other zones.

Decimal (`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/decimal.rs`,
`Rule<rust_decimal::Decimal>`, return `DecimalError`; behind the
`decimal` Cargo feature):

- `DecimalPositive` — admits only `value > 0`. Zero rejected.
- `DecimalScale<S>` — `value.scale() == S` exactly (strict equality;
  callers rescale before construction). `S` must be in `0..=28`,
  enforced by `const { assert!(...) }`.
- `DecimalPrecision<P>` — significant-digit count `<= P` (mantissa
  digit count; zero is treated as 0 significant digits, admitted for
  every `P`).
- `DecimalInRange<MIN_REPR, MAX_REPR, SCALE>` — closed range encoded
  as `(MIN_REPR / 10^SCALE) ..= (MAX_REPR / 10^SCALE)`. Same
  ratio-style const-generic dodge as `InClosedRange` for `f64`.
  Compile-time checks: `SCALE <= 28`, `MIN_REPR <= MAX_REPR`, both
  bounds within `rust_decimal` mantissa range (`±(2^96 - 1)`).

## Patterns

### Newtype hiding rule composition (the load-bearing pattern)

When the underlying rule is `And<X, Y, ...>` (or `Or<...>`), wrap it
in a hand-written tuple newtype with a private field and define a
flat domain error enum. Implement `try_new` to call `Refined::try_new`
and map the rules' shared error variants into your flat domain
variants. The composition's `Self::Error` is the rules' shared flat
enum (or `[E; 2]` for `Or`), so the match is a direct 1:1 mapping —
no positional indirection.

Anti-pattern (do not do this):

```rust
// Leaks whittle into the public API: callers must import And, AtLeast,
// AtMost, StringError just to read the error type.
pub type FlightNumber = Refined<String, And<LenChars<3, 7>, EachChar<...>>>;
pub type FlightNumberError = StringError;
```

Pattern:

```rust
// Public surface: nominal type + flat error enum. The inner
// composition is anonymous — only `FlightNumber` is named.
pub struct FlightNumber(
    Refined<String, And<LenChars<3, 7>, EachChar<AsciiAlphanumeric>>>,
);

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum FlightNumberError {
    BadLength { actual: usize },
    BadCharacter { offset: usize },
}

// Hand-rolled `Display` + `Error` — whittle is agnostic about
// error-derive macros. `thiserror`, `snafu`, `miette`, or no derive
// at all all work; the `Rule` trait only needs
// `Debug + Display + core::error::Error` on `Rule::Error`.
impl core::fmt::Display for FlightNumberError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut core::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> core::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            Self::BadLength { actual } =>
                write!(f, "flight number length {actual} not in 3..=7"),
            Self::BadCharacter { offset } =>
                write!(f, "flight number contains non-alphanumeric at byte offset {offset}"),
        }
    }
}
impl core::error::Error for FlightNumberError {}

impl FlightNumber {
    pub fn try_new(raw: String) -> Result<Self, FlightNumberError> {
        Refined::try_new(raw).map(Self).map_err(|err: StringError| match err {
            StringError::CharCountOutOfRange { actual } =>
                FlightNumberError::BadLength { actual },
            StringError::BadChar { offset } =>
                FlightNumberError::BadCharacter { offset },
            // The composition only emits the two variants above.
            // Listing the rest explicitly turns any future
            // `StringError` variant into a compile error here.
            StringError::ByteLenOutOfRange { .. }
            | StringError::Empty
            | StringError::BadFirstChar
            | StringError::BadHexLength { .. } => unreachable!(
                "composition emits only CharCountOutOfRange and BadChar"
            ),
        })
    }
    // as_inner / into_inner delegate to self.0.
}
```

The user's flight-number example, the kernel's own `Within<MIN, MAX>`
(see `crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/numeric.rs`), and `Finite`
(see `crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/float.rs`) all follow this
shape: domain newtype, flat domain error, the composition's shared
error variants mapped to named variants inside `try_new`.

### Transformers for canonical form

Wrap a validation rule in `AsciiLowercase<R>`, `AsciiUppercase<R>`, or
`Trim<R>` when the storage form should be canonical. The transformer runs
before the inner rule, so:

- The stored carrier is post-transform. `try_new("  Hello  ")` through
  `Trim<AsciiLowercase<NonEmpty>>` stores `"hello"` — the outer `Trim`
  runs first, the inner `AsciiLowercase` runs next, and the validation
  rule `NonEmpty` then sees the canonical form.
- Two inputs that differ only in transformer-equivalent ways (surrounding
  whitespace, letter case, etc.) produce equal `Refined` values.
- Transformers compose with each other (`Trim<AsciiLowercase<R>>`): the
  outer transformer runs first. See
  `crates/whittle-core/src/transform.rs:258`.

The headline use case is `HexFixedNormalized<LEN>` — a type alias for
`AsciiLowercase<HexFixedAny<LEN>>` that accepts hashes in any case and
stores the canonical lowercase form. See
`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/string.rs:572`.

Tradeoff: silently rewriting input is a different semantic from
validation-only. Use transformers only when canonical form is part of the
contract (hex hashes, hostnames, IANA tokens). For invariants where the
input should be preserved verbatim, use the validation-only rule directly.

### Weakening a proof without erasing it (`weaken`)

Reach for `weaken` when a function accepts a looser refinement than the
one you hold — e.g. you have a `Refined<u16, Within<10, 20>>` and the
callee takes `Refined<u16, Within<0, 100>>`. The proof-erasing
alternative (`into_inner` → `try_new`) re-runs the rule and forces the
caller to handle an error that cannot happen; `weaken` moves the value
and converts the proof in place:

```rust
let tight: Refined<u16, Within<10, 20>> = Refined::try_new(15)?;
let wide: Refined<u16, Within<0, 100>> = tight.weaken();
```

The conversion is gated on `S: Implies<W>`; the library supplies the
numeric and length family edges (see Core API), and custom rule pairs
declare their own edge with `impl Implies<Weaker> for Stronger {}` after
documenting the IDEA §5.7 three-property contract (admissibility
containment, canonical-form compatibility, no re-run dependence). Do not
declare self-edges (`impl Implies<R> for R`); the degenerate
instantiation of a library family edge (`Within<0, 100>` →
`Within<0, 100>`) is fine and is a no-op.

### Closed-set enums (`closed_set!`)

When a provider field is a small fixed set of nominal wire tokens
parsed into an enum (`"active"`/`"inactive"`, branch codes, ISO
currency codes), do not reach for `Refined` at all. The enum is
already constructive — its representable states are exactly the
admissible states — so the right artifact is the enum plus one
declaration of the wire table:

```rust
whittle::closed_set! {
    /// Account activity status.
    pub enum ActivityStatus {
        /// The account is in active use.
        Active = "active",
        /// The account is dormant.
        Inactive = "inactive",
    }
}

let status: ActivityStatus = "active".parse()?;   // FromStr → parse
assert_eq!(status.to_string(), "active");          // Display → as_str
```

The declaration is the single determinant. The macro generates the
enum, the injective `ClosedSet::MEMBERS` table, the standard derive
set (`Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, PartialOrd, Ord` —
do not re-derive these via the attribute passthrough),
`FromStr`/`TryFrom<&str>`/`Display`, and — behind the `serde`
feature — `Serialize`/`Deserialize` with a plain-string wire shape
routed through `parse`. Behind the `proptest` feature,
`closed_set::admissible::<E>()` (select-from-table, admissible by
construction) and `closed_set::rejects::<E>()` (derived case-flips,
truncations, extensions, empty string, filtered arbitrary) come
from the same table, so boundary tests need no hand-maintained
reject list. Rejections carry the bounded offending value and the
expected set; a duplicate wire string is a compile error. v1 is
injective-only: exact, case-sensitive matching, no aliases.

Least-power decision table:

| You have | Reach for |
|---|---|
| Fixed wire tokens ↔ enum variants | `closed_set!` |
| Enum with no wire form | plain enum |
| Positional string grammar (prefixes, segments) | `pattern!` |
| Bounded / char-class string | `Refined<String, …>` newtype |
| Subset of a foreign enum | smaller local enum + `From` impl |

Why not the alternatives:

- `Refined<String, OneOfStrings<…>>` — predicative carrier: every
  consumer matches on strings behind `_ => unreachable!()` arms,
  and the enum (where representable = admissible) already exists.
- `Pattern<"^(?:active|inactive)$">` — over-powered: regex engine
  capability is pure gap for a finite nominal set, the `NoMatch`
  error is opaque, members are not enumerable for generation or
  reject derivation, and it drags `regex` + nightly + `std` into a
  dependency-free invariant.
- A plain enum with a hand-written `try_new` — redeclares the same
  admitted set in the parser, the tests, and the error (many
  determinants for one fact), with per-consumer coverage burden.
- Enum-side subset markers (`OnlyVariants<…>`) — deliberately
  deferred (IDEA §5.6): a smaller local enum with
  `From<Local> for Foreign` strictly dominates until the documented
  hard case shows up (overlapping subsets of one foreign enum).

### Serde integration

`Refined<T, R>: Deserialize` delegates to a per-rule hook,
`DeserializeRule<'de, T>`. Most rules use the default parse-then-refine
path (`parse_then_refine`): deserialise `T`, then route through
`Refined::try_new`. The rule's `Error` must implement `Display`;
rejections surface as `serde::de::Error::custom(rule_error)`. Either
way there is no admissible code path that produces a `Refined` without
the rule's admissibility predicate holding. Bad JSON is rejected with
the rule's own message; good JSON produces a refined value.

**Custom rules need a one-liner** to keep deserialising (the blanket
no longer covers every `Rule<T>` automatically):

```rust
whittle::deserialize_rule! {
    impl[] DeserializeRule<String> for MyRule
}
```

`impl[...]` carries the rule's generics; `where [...]` carries extra
bounds. Hand-written `Deserialize` impls on newtypes (tuple carriers
and the like) are unaffected.

**Length-bounded collections stream their bound by default.**
`Refined<Vec<T>, LenItems<MIN, MAX>>` enforces `MAX` *while* the
sequence decodes: pre-allocation is clamped to `min(size_hint, MAX)`,
at most `MAX` elements are materialized, and an over-long payload is
drained (`IgnoredAny`, counted but never decoded as `T`) so the error
still reports the true total length at O(MAX) memory. Accept/reject
set and error text match `try_new` exactly — only the allocation
profile differs. The type layer bounds element materialization itself;
a transport-level byte cap is a separate layer doing its own job.
`And` / `All` forward to their FIRST operand's hook, so put `LenItems`
on the left of a collection conjunction to stream the whole
composition. Scope limits: `Or` / `Any` would need to retry against
buffered raw input, so they (and `Not` / `Xor`) take the default path;
`MapErr` takes the default path so its error mapping keeps running;
serde delivers strings whole, so `LenChars` / `LenBytes` cannot abort
mid-decode at this layer. One streaming corner: elements past `MAX`
are syntax-checked, not decoded as `T`, so an over-long payload with
a bad tail element reports the length error rather than the decode
error (rejected either way).

`Refined<T, R>::serialize` forwards to `T` — refined values look identical
on the wire to their underlying primitive.

`#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` is `T`'s decision, not whittle's. Serde
does not expose field-level callbacks to outer adapters, so `Refined<T, R>`
cannot enforce `deny_unknown_fields` from outside. Put the attribute on
the inner `T` struct; see the doc comment on `Refined`'s `Deserialize`
impl in `crates/whittle-core/src/rule.rs`.

For hand-written newtypes around `Refined`, derive `serde::Deserialize`
on the newtype to forward to `Refined<T, R>::deserialize`. The
`refinement!` simple form generates a tuple newtype around `Refined`;
serde derives flow through the same path. The error-block form emits
the serde impls itself (do not also derive them): because its inner
rule is `MapErr<Rule, FooError>`, a deserialize-time rejection
surfaces the domain error's `Display` text instead of the raw rule
text — the ingress diagnostics match `try_new`'s.

### Property-based testing

With the `proptest` feature, `Refined<T, R>` implements `Arbitrary` for
every `R: ArbitraryRule<T>`. The blanket `Refined<T, R>: Arbitrary` impl
does no rejection sampling — it maps the rule's strategy through
`try_new` and panics on bugs. Each primitive rule supplies a constructive
strategy (range, regex, vec-of-element). Composition retains a bounded
amount of filtering: `And<A, B>`'s strategy filters `A`'s output through
`B::refine`. Place the narrowing rule on the *left* so the filter rate
stays tractable. For sparse intersections, a future n-ary `All<(...)>`
may admit direct intersection generators.

Each primitive rule's strategy targets the admissible region directly.
Rules over dense regions (`NotNan`, `NonZero`, `NoneOf<P>`, ...) use a
single `prop_filter` whose reject rate is negligible; rules over sparse
regions (`Within<MIN, MAX>`, `LenChars<MIN, MAX>`, hex) construct values
inside the admissible region without filtering. `Within<0, 100>` over
`i32` (101 values out of 2^32) is as cheap to sample as `NonZero` (every
i32 except 0).

Downstream tests can write `let r in any::<Refined<T, R>>()` for any
library-supplied rule and trust every generated value satisfies the
invariant — no `prop_assume!` filtering, no narrower-strategy
workarounds.

`ArbitraryRule<T>` is a sub-trait of `Rule<T>` with one method:

```text
trait ArbitraryRule<T>: Rule<T> {
    type Strategy: proptest::strategy::Strategy<Value = T>;
    fn arbitrary_strategy() -> Self::Strategy;
}
```

Implementers carry a soundness obligation: every value emitted by the
returned strategy MUST satisfy `R::refine`. The blanket impl `expect`s
on `try_new`, so a strategy bug surfaces as a panic at test time, not
as silently dropped samples.

Four sub-traits expose building blocks rule strategies need:

- `ArbitraryNumeric` — per-integer-type range strategy. Each numeric
  primitive uses it: `Within<MIN, MAX>` calls
  `T::arbitrary_in_range(MIN, MAX)` to get exactly the admissible region.
- `ArbitraryFloat` — per-float-type strategies (`any`, `finite`,
  closed-range). The float primitives (`NotNan`, `NotInfinite`,
  `Finite`, `InClosedRange`) use these.
- `ArbitraryChar` — per-`CharPredicate` `char` strategy. `EachChar<P>`
  and `FirstChar<P>` compose it into a `String` strategy. Every
  library-supplied predicate (`AsciiAlphanumeric`, `IdentChar`,
  `IdentStart`, `IdentDashChar`, `NonControl`, `HexChar`,
  `PrintableLine`, `PrintableMultiline`, `PrintableChar`) has an
  `ArbitraryChar` impl.
- `ArbitraryPredicate<T>` — per-`Predicate<T>` value strategy used by
  `AnyOf<P>` to seed the generated collection with a guaranteed match.

Every public `Strategy` associated type resolves to
`proptest::strategy::BoxedStrategy<T>`, so consumers see an opaque
strategy type instead of a concrete combinator stack
(`Map<VecStrategy<CharStrategy<'static>>, fn(...) -> String>`). The
boxing adds one heap allocation per strategy instantiation
(per-property-test, not per-sample) and keeps the public surface
tractable to read.

For a custom rule that wraps the library primitives:

- Delegate to the inner rule's strategy.
  `refinement! { pub Foo: Inner, Rule; }` does not implement
  `ArbitraryRule` for the newtype; if you
  want `proptest::any::<Foo>()` to work, hand-write `ArbitraryRule<...>`
  on the rule type and call `proptest::strategy::Strategy::prop_map` to
  wrap the inner value in your newtype.
- For composed rules, `And<A, B>` and `Or<A, B>` derive `ArbitraryRule`
  automatically when their components do. `And` uses `A`'s strategy
  filtered through `B::refine`; pick `A` to be the
  generator-shaped rule and `B` to be the predicate-shaped one. `Or`
  is `prop_oneof!`.

Transformers are reflected in the `Arbitrary` distribution: the inner
rule's strategy generates raw `T`, the transformer normalises, and the
stored carrier is the canonical form. Property tests that assert "every
stored value equals its own canonical form" hold by construction.

**Don't use filtering to make sparse rules pass.** When a custom
`Rule<T>` admits only a sparse region of `T` (e.g., a numeric rule
that admits 100 values out of 2³²), the cost of writing a smart
`ArbitraryRule` strategy is critical. The wrong reflex is to define a
generic `Rule<T>` strategy that filters from `T::arbitrary()` — that
is the rejection-sampling pattern that breaks on sparse rules. The
right pattern: encode the admissible-set shape directly. For
range-restricted rules, use proptest's range strategies; for
character-set rules, use `prop_oneof!` over admissible chars; for
collection rules, use `proptest::collection::vec` over the inner
element strategy.

**Transformers need stability proofs.** Wrapping a rule `R` in a
transformer like `Trim<R>`, `AsciiLowercase<R>`, or
`AsciiUppercase<R>` requires `R` to be *stable under the
transformation*: if `R` admits some `v` but rejects `f(v)`, then
`Refined<String, Transform<R>>::try_new(v)` will fail at the strategy
level — the `expect` in the blanket `Arbitrary` impl panics.
Whittle's kernel encodes this with capability marker traits
(`StableUnderTrim`, `StableUnderAsciiLowercase`,
`StableUnderAsciiUppercase`) that each rule implements only when it
genuinely satisfies the property. Custom rule authors should add
their own marker impls for transformers they want to compose with;
`And<A, B>` and `Or<A, B>` carry the marker when both operands do.

The 4-step audit recipe for adding a new `StableUnder*` marker is
documented on the `StableUnderTrim` trait's docstring in
`crates/whittle-core/src/transform.rs`. Follow it whenever introducing
a new transformer or a new marker impl.

#### Boundary-matrix checklist (manual)

Constructor faithfulness — the smart constructor accepts *exactly* the
admitted set — is tested on the constructor with a hand-written
boundary matrix. For **each bounded rule conversion** (a new
`Refined<T, R>` / `refinement!` newtype whose rule carries MIN/MAX
bounds), write these five tests, asserting the **exact error variant**
on every reject (not a bare `is_err()`):

1. **Accept at MIN** — `try_new(min)` succeeds; inner value
   round-trips.
2. **Accept at MAX** — `try_new(max)` succeeds; inner value
   round-trips.
3. **Reject at MIN − 1** — `try_new(min - 1)` fails with the exact
   variant (e.g. `NumericError::OutOfRange { value }`,
   `StringError::TooShort { .. }`). For `MIN = 0` length rules this
   case is unrepresentable — document the skip at the test site.
4. **Reject at MAX + 1** — `try_new(max + 1)` fails with the exact
   variant.
5. **One charset/class miss** — where the rule constrains content as
   well as bounds (charset, hex, pattern, per-char predicate), one
   in-bounds input with a single forbidden character, asserting the
   exact variant (e.g. `StringError::BadChar { offset }`).

This matrix is the input-side counterpart of the
`whittle::testing` harness (`prop_total` / `prop_image_refines`),
which covers totality and image-validity; the edge-biased generators
cover boundary reachability. The matrix alone pins the accept/reject
*frontier*.

**Why no generator (R-T1 deferred).** A macro that emits this matrix
is deferred until schema reflection (IDEA §5.9) lands. Without a
schema the generator cannot read MIN/MAX off the rule, so the bounds
would have to be restated at the test site — a second determinant for
the same bound, the exact P3 ("one determinant") violation whittle
exists to remove. Once the rule tree is reflectable, the matrix can be
derived from the single in-type declaration; until then, write the
five cases by hand.

### Feature gating

Workspace root `Cargo.toml` lists workspace-level features
(`crates/whittle-core/Cargo.toml`):

- `hex` — enables `HexChar`, `HexFixedLower<LEN>`, `HexFixedAny<LEN>`,
  `HexFixedNormalized<LEN>`. No external deps.
- `unicode` — enables `PrintableLine`, `PrintableMultiline`, and
  `PrintableChar`. Pulls in `unicode-general-category` for the
  `PrintableChar` General-Category lookup; `PrintableLine` and
  `PrintableMultiline` remain dep-free hardcoded subsets.
- `decimal` — enables `DecimalPositive`, `DecimalScale<S>`,
  `DecimalPrecision<P>`, `DecimalInRange<MIN_REPR, MAX_REPR, SCALE>`.
  Pulls in `rust_decimal`.
- `chrono` — enables the `Date` and `DateTime` rule families
  (`DateAtLeast`, `DateAtMost`, `DateInRange` over `NaiveDate`;
  `DateTimeAtLeast`, `DateTimeAtMost`, `DateTimeInRange` over
  `DateTime<Utc>`). Pulls in `chrono` (no_std-compatible, no `clock`
  feature).
- `serde` — enables `Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls on `Refined<T, R>`.
- `proptest` — enables `Arbitrary` impl on `Refined<T, R>`.
- `regex` — enables `Pattern<const RE: &'static str>` and the
  `pattern!` macro. Unlike every other feature, this one pulls in
  `std` (the regex compile cache needs `OnceLock`/`Mutex`) and turns
  on the nightly `adt_const_params` / `unsized_const_params`
  const-generic features so a `&'static str` can be a const generic.
  Pulls in the `regex` crate (and `whittle-macros` for `pattern!`).
  Reach for it only for positional grammars the character-class rules
  cannot express; see the `Pattern` entry in the Primitive Catalog.

`default = []`. The crate is `#![no_std]` with `extern crate alloc`
(plus `extern crate std` only under the `regex` feature). All
features are additive.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not expose `Refined<T, R>` as a public field. It leaks whittle into
  your API surface and freezes the rule's internal structure. Wrap in a
  nominal newtype.
- Do not write `pub type Foo = Refined<T, R>;` for a domain type. Same
  leak as above. Use the `refinement!` macro or hand-write a tuple
  newtype.
- Do not expose the rules' shared error enum directly as your
  domain error. Map it into a named domain enum — the
  `refinement!` error block declares that mapping once — even when
  both inner rules already share the same flat enum (`StringError`,
  `NumericError`, etc.); the rename is the contract. For
  `Or<A, B>`, do not expose the raw `[E; 2]` pair; collapse it into
  a single named variant (hand-written; the error block maps a
  single shared enum, not the positional pair).
- Do not re-validate downstream. The whole point of the carrier is that
  `&Refined<T, R>` witnesses the invariant. If a function takes
  `&Refined<String, R>`, it does not need to re-check the rule. (If you
  feel the urge to re-check, ask whether the invariant is actually fully
  captured by `R`.)
- Do not `#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]` to silence
  coverage. The project forbids this — coverage gaps must be closed with
  real tests. For compile-time const-generic checks, use
  `const { assert!(...) }`; for runtime branches, add a per-
  monomorphization test that exercises both the `Ok` and `Err` paths.
- Do not add a `&str`-based primitive. The kernel's `Rule<T>` requires
  `T: 'static`; every string primitive is `Rule<String>`. `&str`-based
  rules would conflict with the planned `Schema` reflection.
- Do not store mutable inner state on a rule. Rules are zero-sized
  markers; they are addressed by type, not by value.

## Process for adding a new domain type

1. State the invariant in one English sentence. Is it expressible via
   existing whittle primitives (numeric range, string length, character
   class, list uniqueness)? If yes, pick the rule or build it with
   `And` / `Or`.
2. Decide nominal newtype vs bare `Refined<T, R>`. Default: nominal
   newtype, because the newtype IS the domain. Bare `Refined<T, R>` is
   appropriate only for crate-internal helper types that never appear in
   a public signature.
3. Choose the error shape:
   - Inner rule's error is already flat AND domain-meaningful (e.g. you
     used a single primitive like `Within<0, 100>` with its own
     `NumericError`): reuse it.
   - Inner rule is an `And` / `All` composition: declare a flat
     domain enum in the `refinement!` error block — the composition's
     `Self::Error` is the rules' shared flat enum, so the arms are a
     flat 1:1 mapping and the macro generates the enum, `Display`,
     `Error`, and the mapping from that one declaration. For
     `Or<A, B>` the error is `[E; 2]` — hand-write the newtype,
     destructure the array, and produce your flat variant (see the
     "Error derive macros are your choice" note below for the
     hand-written enum's impls).
4. Implement:
   - For single-error rules whose flat enum is domain-meaningful,
     the simple form `refinement! { pub Foo: Inner, Rule; }` is
     enough — it generates the newtype + `try_new` + `as_inner` +
     `into_inner` and forwards the error unchanged.
   - For composition-flattening, use the error-block form: the same
     declaration plus `error SourceErr => pub FooError { ... }`
     generates the newtype, the flat enum, `Display`/`Error`, the
     single `ErrorMapper` determinant, `AsRef`, opt-in carrier
     `Display` (`impl Display;`), and serde impls. List the residual
     source variants in the `unreachable` arm (omit it for a total
     mapping). Hand-write the newtype only for `Or<...>`'s `[E; 2]`
     pair collapse.
   - Hand-write `From` and other conversions as needed; neither form
     generates them.
5. Tests:
   - Admit and reject per error variant. For composition-flattening
     newtypes, hit every `match` arm.
   - Property tests through the type's `Arbitrary` strategy (when
     `proptest` is on) — confirm every generated value satisfies the
     invariant. For sparse rules, drive a narrower inner strategy.
   - Doctest in the type's doc comment showing both the admit shape and
     a reject shape. Match the kernel's primitives (e.g.
     `crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/numeric.rs:14`) for style.
6. If the type belongs in `whittle-core` (load-bearing across the
   workspace), add it under `crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/` and
   re-export through `crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/mod.rs`. If it is
   application-domain (`FlightNumber`, `AccountId`), keep it in the
   downstream crate.

**Error derive macros are your choice.** Whittle's kernel is
dep-free — `whittle-core`'s primitive errors (`NumericError`,
`StringError`, `FloatError`, `CollectionError`, `PathError`) are
hand-rolled `impl Display + impl Error`, so downstream `cargo tree`
shows no `thiserror` (or any other error-derive crate) under whittle.
The `Rule` trait does NOT require any specific derive — `Rule::Error`
only needs
`Debug + Display + core::error::Error`. Your domain errors can use
`thiserror`, `snafu`, `miette`, or hand-roll — whittle is agnostic.
Parts of the test corpus under `tests/` use `thiserror` for brevity
(it is a workspace `[dev-dependencies]` entry, never a production
dependency), proving the derive integrates cleanly without forcing
it on downstream consumers. Enums generated by the `refinement!`
error block are the exception: their `Display` + `Error` impls are
already emitted, so adding `thiserror::Error` through the attribute
passthrough is a conflict.

## Examples

See `./tests/` for integration tests that double as runnable examples
covering each pattern. Each file is a self-contained Cargo integration
test binary with a `//!` doc comment explaining what it shows and one or
more `#[test]` functions whose bodies are the demonstration. Run them
with `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` or
`cargo test --tests --all-features`. Bare `cargo test` and
`cargo nextest run` also pass: feature-gated integration tests
(`serde-roundtrip`, `proptest-arbitrary`, `hex-and-normalization`) are
declared with `required-features` in the root `Cargo.toml`, so Cargo
skips them when the relevant feature is off. Nextest's profile defaults
live in `.config/nextest.toml`. (If absent, the kernel's own doctests in
`crates/whittle-core/src/primitive/` are the next-best reading list:
every primitive includes admit-and-reject doctests, and the
`Within` / `Finite` newtype-hiding-composition pattern is illustrated by
their own implementations.)

## Validation Checklist

A whittle domain type is well-formed when:

- The invariant is stated in a doc comment on the newtype.
- The newtype is nominal (a struct or `refinement!` invocation), not a
  `pub type` alias to `Refined<T, R>`.
- The inner `Refined` field is private. Construction goes through
  `try_new`; access goes through `as_inner` / `into_inner`.
- The public error type is a flat enum with `Debug + PartialEq + Eq`
  and `Display` + `Error` impls (generated by the `refinement!` error
  block, derived with any macro you prefer, or hand-written). The
  rules' shared error enum (or `[E; 2]` for `Or`) is mapped to named
  domain variants — the underlying enum is not the public surface.
- Doctests cover at least one admit case and one reject case.
- If `proptest` is on, an `Arbitrary` round-trip test confirms every
  generated value satisfies the invariant.
- If `serde` is on and the type is reachable from a deserialised payload,
  a test confirms invalid input is rejected with the rule's error message.
- Per-monomorphization coverage: every concrete `Rule::refine` impl that
  the type produces is exercised by both an `Ok`-path and an `Err`-path
  test.
- No `coverage(off)` attribute is used to silence missing coverage.
- Downstream code does not re-check the invariant the type already
  witnesses.

## Git hooks

Two hooks enforce the gates locally. Their canonical bodies are tracked
in `scripts/hooks/`; `.git/hooks/` is not version-controlled, so install
them once after cloning:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

- `pre-commit` runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (fast, per commit).
- `pre-push` runs `cargo coverage` and aborts the push unless coverage
  is 100% on regions, lines, functions, and branches. It resolves the
  pinned toolchain's `llvm-cov` / `llvm-profdata` from the active
  sysroot, so `cargo-llvm-cov` finds them even when installed against a
  different channel. Coverage is deliberately on pre-push rather than
  pre-commit: it is too slow per commit and would break the atomic
  red/green/refactor workflow, where intermediate commits legitimately
  are not yet 100% until a later commit adds the covering tests.
